[![CI/CD](https://github.com/vertigis/workflow-activities-cartegraph/workflows/CI/CD/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vertigis/workflow-activities-cartegraph/actions)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@vertigis/workflow-activities-cartegraph)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertigis/workflow-activities-cartegraph)

This project contains activities for interacting with the [Cartegraph](https://www.cartegraph.com/) REST API in a [VertiGIS Studio Workflow](https://www.vertigisstudio.com/products/vertigis-studio-workflow/).

## Requirements

### Cartegraph Versions

The Cartegraph activities are designed to work with Cartegraph versions `28.1` and above.

### VertiGIS Studio Workflow Versions

The Cartegraph activities are designed to work with VertiGIS Studio Workflow versions `5.36` and above.

## Usage

To use the Cartegraph activities in [VertiGIS Studio Workflow Designer](https://apps.vertigisstudio.com/workflow/designer/) you need to register an activity pack and then add the activities to a workflow.

### Register the Cartegraph activity pack

1. Sign in to ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS
1. Go to **My Content**
1. Select **Add Item > An application**
    - Type: `Web Mapping`
    - Purpose: `Ready To Use`
    - API: `JavaScript`
    - URL: The URL to this activity pack manifest
        - Use https://unpkg.com/@vertigis/workflow-activities-cartegraph/activitypack.json for the latest version
        - Use https://unpkg.com/@vertigis/workflow-activities-cartegraph@1/activitypack.json for the latest revision of a specific major version
        - Use https://unpkg.com/@vertigis/workflow-activities-cartegraph@1.0.0/activitypack.json for a specific version
        - Use https://localhost:5000/activitypack.json for a local development version
    - Title: Your desired title
    - Tags: Must include `geocortex-workflow-activity-pack`
1. Reload [VertiGIS Studio Workflow Designer](https://apps.vertigisstudio.com/workflow/designer/)
1. The Cartegraph activities will now appear in the activity toolbox in a `Cartegraph` category

### Use the Cartegraph activities in a workflow

1. Establish a connection to the Cartegraph service
    1. Add the `Create Cartegraph Service` activity to a workflow
    1. Set the `URL` input to the root URL of your Cartegraph server. For example, `https://yourserver.com/cartegraph`.
1. Ensure the user is signed into Cartegraph in their current web browser session
    1. Add the `Get Cartegraph Session Info` activity to a workflow
    1. Set the `Service` input of the activity to be the output of the `Create Cartegraph Service` activity
    1. If the `isAuthenticated` output of the activity is `true` then the user is signed in. If the user is not signed in, do one of the following:
        - Use a `Display Form` activity to present the user with a message that they need to sign into Cartegraph first. 
            - The form could include a link to the Cartegraph sign-in page using `=$cgService1.service.signInUrl`.
        - Use a `Display Form` activity to prompt the user for their username and password and provide them to the `Username` and `Password` inputs of the `Cartegraph Sign In` activity
            - **IMPORTANT:** passwords should never be hard coded into workflows. These values should be acquired by the workflow at runtime from the end user or from another secure system.
1. Use the Cartegraph service
    1. Add one of the other Cartegraph activities to the workflow. For example, `Get Cartegraph Record`.
    1. Set the `Service` input of the activity to be the output of the `Create Cartegraph Service` activity
        - Typically this would use an expression like `=$cgService1.service`
    1. Supply any additional inputs to the activity
    1. Supply the `result` output of the activity to the inputs of other activities in the workflow
1. Run the workflow

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with the [VertiGIS Studio Workflow SDK](https://github.com/vertigis/vertigis-workflow-sdk). Before you can use your activity pack in the [VertiGIS Studio Workflow Designer](https://apps.vertigisstudio.com/workflow/designer/), you will need to [register the activity pack](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/sdk-web-overview#register-the-activity-pack).

## Available Scripts

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm run generate`

Interactively generate a new activity or form element.

### `npm start`

Runs the project in development mode. Your activity pack will be available at [http://localhost:5000/main.js](http://localhost:5000/main.js). The HTTPS certificate of the development server is a self-signed certificate that web browsers will warn about. To work around this open [`https://localhost:5000/main.js`](https://localhost:5000/main.js) in a web browser and allow the invalid certificate as an exception. For creating a locally-trusted HTTPS certificate see the [Configuring a HTTPS Certificate](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/sdk-web-overview/#configuring-a-https-certificate) section on the [VertiGIS Studio Developer Center](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/overview/).

### `npm run build`

Builds the activity pack for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your custom activity pack is now ready to be deployed!

See the [section about deployment](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/sdk-web-overview/#deployment) in the [VertiGIS Studio Developer Center](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/workflow/overview/) for more information.
